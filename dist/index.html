  Michael LoPiccolo<br><br>
  I'm studying CS and Math at the University of Texas at Dallas. Right now (early 2017) I'm trying to start a career in academia, applying to REUs and other summer research programs!<br><br>
  I haven't had time to make a real website yet, but I did buy this domain, so I'll host a few things here!<br><br>
  <a href="CV - Michael LoPiccolo.pdf">My CV (updated Feb 2017)</a>. <br><br>

  <a href="Fairness Under the Microscope of Big Data - Michael LoPiccolo.pdf">My research paper</a> describing efforts towards fairness and nondiscrimination with big data systems.<br>Recently I've been extremely interested in this topic area, as well as differential privacy, to which it is similar.<br><br>
